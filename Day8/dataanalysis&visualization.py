# For Day 8, let's focus on mastering Python libraries for data analysis and visualization.
# Specifically, we'll work with NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, which are essential for data manipulation, 
# analysis, and visualization.

# Topics to Cover
# NumPy: Understanding arrays and basic operations
# Pandas: DataFrames, data manipulation, and analysis
# Matplotlib: Data visualization
# Learning Objectives
# Understand how to create and manipulate NumPy arrays.
# Learn how to use Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
# Understand how to create basic plots using Matplotlib.

import numpy as np

# Create arrays of zeros, ones, and fives
zeros = np.zeros(10)
ones = np.ones(10) * 2
fives = np.ones(10) * 5

print("Zeros:", zeros)
print("Ones:", ones)
print("Fives:", fives)
